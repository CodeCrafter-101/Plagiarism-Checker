The Amazon rainforest is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth, home to millions of species of plants, animals, and insects. It plays a critical role in regulating the global climate by absorbing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Deforestation, however, continues to threaten this delicate ecosystem, with large areas being cleared for agriculture, mining, and infrastructure development.
